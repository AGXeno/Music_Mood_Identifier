# Spotify API Integration

## What's Been Implemented

### ✅ Real Spotify API Integration
- **Spotify Client Credentials Flow**: Automatic token management with refresh
- **Fallback to Mock Data**: Graceful degradation when API credentials aren't configured
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with fallback to curated mock recommendations

### ✅ Enhanced Sentiment Analysis
- **Real TensorFlow.js Integration**: Actual sentiment scoring (joy, sadness, anger, fear)
- **User Preference Adjustment**: Scores adjusted based on user history (Jim = country, Stephanie = pop)
- **Multi-emotional Weighting**: All emotions contribute to music recommendations, not just dominant one

### ✅ Smart Music Mapping
- **Advanced Genre Selection**: Maps emotions to appropriate genres based on user preferences
- **Spotify Audio Features**: Uses valence, energy, danceability, and popularity for precise matching
- **Weighted Calculations**: Sophisticated algorithm combining multiple emotions for nuanced recommendations

### ✅ Improved User Experience
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during analysis
- **Error Display**: Clear error messages when things go wrong
- **Real-time Progress**: Console logging for debugging and transparency

## How It Works

### For Users With Spotify Credentials:
1. **Text Input**: "I'm feeling really energetic and happy today!"
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: joy: 0.8, sadness: 0.1, anger: 0.05, fear: 0.05
3. **Spotify API Call**: Searches for upbeat, high-energy songs with high valence
4. **Real Recommendations**: Returns actual Spotify tracks with preview URLs, album info, etc.

### For Users Without Spotify Credentials:
1. **Automatic Fallback**: Detects missing credentials and uses curated mock data
2. **Emotion-Specific Playlists**: Hand-picked songs for each emotional state
3. **Maintains Quality**: High-quality recommendations even without API access

### Example Outputs:

**Happy Input**: 
- Genres: pop, funk, dance
- Features: valence: 0.8, energy: 0.7, danceability: 0.8
- Result: Upbeat, danceable tracks like "Happy" by Pharrell Williams

**Sad Input**:
- Genres: indie, folk, blues (or country for Jim)
- Features: valence: 0.3, energy: 0.4, danceability: 0.3
- Result: Contemplative tracks like "Someone Like You" by Adele

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Spotify Credentials
```bash
# Visit https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
# Create new app
# Copy Client ID and Client Secret
```

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your credentials
REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id
REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret
```

### 3. Test the Integration
```bash
# Start the app
npm start

# Try these test scenarios:
# 1. "I'm super excited about my new job!" (should get energetic pop/dance)
# 2. "Feeling nostalgic and missing old friends" (should get melancholic indie/folk)
# 3. Login as Jim and try country-specific recommendations
# 4. Login as Stephanie for pop-focused suggestions
```

## Files Modified
- `src/services/SpotifyAPI.js` - Complete rewrite with real API integration
- `src/config/spotifyConfig.js` - New configuration file
- `src/App.js` - Integration of Spotify service and sentiment analyzer
- `.env.example` - Template for Spotify credentials

## Technical Features
- **Token Caching**: Reuses valid tokens to avoid unnecessary API calls
- **Request Timeout**: 5-second timeout prevents hanging requests
- **Genre Limits**: Respects Spotify's 3-genre limit for recommendations
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed console output for debugging
- **Type Safety**: Consistent data structures between real and mock data
